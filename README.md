Level 1 Process
    Create your HTML page and include a nav section, a footer section, and a content section with headings 
    (you can use Lorem Ipsum if needed)
    Make an external style sheet and link it to your HTML page. Place all your styles into this external stylesheet
    Style the body element. See how all the elements inside the body tag inherit the styles you set.
    Style the footer and nav. As you get more specific, you'll see how it overwrites the styles set on the body tag.
    Create classes and IDs and see how they in turn also overwrite less specific styles.

Level 2 Process

  Try overwriting styles by introducing inline styles. This is just to see how the specificity works, and should 
  not be used as a method of writing styles. All styles should be written in our external stylesheet.
